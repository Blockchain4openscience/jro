- Notebooks/Tutorial 2 - Guide to convert the chemcial potential values used in tutorial 1 into meaningful values
- Notebooks/Tutorial 3 - Guide to convert chemical potential to pressure
- Notebooks/Tutroial 4 - Guide for creating a phase diagram for a surface as a function of temperature and pressure.
